# 🌊 Davao FloodSense: Ensemble Risk Mapper

A web-based flood susceptibility mapping application for Davao City, Mindanao, Philippines. Uses ensemble machine learning (Random Forest + XGBoost) to assess flood risk based on terrain and environmental factors.

## 🎯 Features

-   **Interactive Map Interface**: OpenStreetMap-based selection within Davao City bounds
-   **Ensemble ML Model**: Combines Random Forest and XGBoost for superior accuracy (AUC 0.87+)
-   **8 Conditioning Factors**: Elevation, Slope, Aspect, Curvature, Distance to River, Rainfall, Land Use, Lithology
-   **Risk Assessment**: Visual gauge showing Low/Moderate/High/Very High susceptibility
-   **Factor Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of why a location has specific risk level
-   **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

-   **TypeScript** - Type safety and improved developer experience
-   **React 18** - Modern frontend framework
-   **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
-   **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
-   **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
-   **Express** - Fast backend web framework
-   **Leaflet** - Interactive maps with OpenStreetMap
-   **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to see the web application.
The API server runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Select Location**: Click anywhere on the map within Davao City (blue boundary) or use "My Location" button
2. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Location" to run the ensemble model
3. **View Results**: See risk gauge, factor breakdown, and recommendations
4. **Learn More**: Click "About" to understand the technology and methodology

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

-   **NOT Real-Time Forecasting**: This tool provides susceptibility mapping using offline data
-   **Planning Tool**: For risk assessment and planning, not emergency response
-   **Davao City Only**: Analysis limited to geographical bounds of Davao City
-   **Academic Prototype**: Demonstration with synthetic training data for educational purposes

## 🎓 Academic Context

Based on research studying flash floods in Davao City caused by complex terrain and upstream rainfall patterns. Known flood-prone areas include Matina Pangi, Talomo, and Buhangin.
